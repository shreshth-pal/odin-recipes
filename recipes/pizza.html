    <h2>The best thing out of Italy</h2>
    <p>Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.</p>
    <p>Another form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold unbaked to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to assemble at home before baking in an oven.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water(110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1.25 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        

    </ul>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). In a medium bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour, salt and oil. Beat until smooth. Let rest for 5 minutes</li>
